## Running The Example

You can run this example as node processes on your localhost, as pods on a local
[minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases) installation.

### Localhost

To run the basic application on your local machine, just run the commands bellow:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

If you want debug information, you can set `DEBUG` environment variable and start the application:

```
$ DEBUG=* npm start
```

This will launch the application on port 8080.

### Minishift

Minishift should be started, and you should be logged in with a currently
active project. Then run the `npm run openshift` command.

```sh
$ minishift start # You may have some options here, e.g. --memory=8096 --vm-driver=virtualbox
$ oc login -u developer # Login
$ oc new-project my-example-project # Create a project to deploy to
$ npm run openshift # Deploys the example app
```

This app has an example of integration test using an [integration test tool for Node.js apps on OpenShift](https://github.com/nodeshift/rhoaster)

Once you started your local OpenShift instance you can check it out by  running the following commands: 

```
npm run test:integration 
```

It will deploy the app to local OpenShift and run the tests located on `test/integration` directory.

```
npm run test:integration:undeploy
```

Performs undeploy of the app inside local OpenShift.
